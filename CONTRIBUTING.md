### Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/snorrwe/lollygag/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/snorrwe/lollygag/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Pull requests must pass all tests on Travis CI and must be peer reviewed by a contributor before they can be merged into _master_. To run the tests locally:
    * Run the tests via (for example) _pytest_. Just run `pytest` in the root directory of the project.
    * Run _pylint_. Run `pylint lollygag` in the root directory of the project.
    
#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

We accept purely cosmetic fixes aswell. Submit a pull request!

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open a new branch for you feature.
* Open a pull request once you finished.
* If you are unsure about the feature open a new issue with the _question_ label and wait for feedback.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**
